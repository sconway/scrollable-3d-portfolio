      <p class="project-details__description">
        Devsamples.com is a website that I created to help other developers,
        while gaining more experience with NextJS, Typescript, and the SanityIO
        CMS. This project catalogs code snippets for various tasks to help
        developers quickly find what they are looking for and solve problems.
      </p>
      <p class="project-details__description">
        This site is built in NextJS due to the SEO requirements, and also has a
        custom ExpressJS server to serve up static files like sitemaps,
        robots.txt, etc. The front-end is built in React, and makes use of the
        SanityIO CMS to provide the content for the site. One particular
        challenge was formatting and styling the code samples, which required a
        third party library and a few customizations to match the theme of the
        website.
