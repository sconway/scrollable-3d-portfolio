      <p class="project-details__description">
        Devsamples.com is a website that I created to help other developers,
        while gaining more experience with NextJS, Typescript, and the SanityIO
        CMS. This project catalogs code snippets for various tasks to help
        developers quickly find what they are looking for and solve problems.
      </p>
      <p class="project-details__description">
        This site is built in NextJS due to the SEO requirements, and also has a
        custom ExpressJS server to serve up static files like sitemaps,
        robots.txt, etc. The front-end is built in React, and makes use of the
        SanityIO CMS to provide the content for the site. One particular
        challenge was formatting and styling the code samples, which required a
        third party library and a few customizations to match the theme of the
        website.

      <h2 class="project-details__title">Arc Advisory Group</h2>
      <p class="project-details__description">
        The website for Arc Advisory Group was rebuilt from the ground up for
        this project. This rebuild involved consolidating all of the different
        services that Arc offered into a smaller number of easy to navigate
        pages. These pages were created with subtle yet fun interactions and
        animations, while also being generic enough to be easily extended and
        repurposed to include any type of content.
      </p>
      <p class="project-details__description">
        This client wanted a a very customizable CMS dashboard to allow them to
        build their own pages with existing components/widgets. This made for
        some interesting challenges, as we had to plan for and defend against a
        myriad of possibilities. To future-proof the front-end of this site, I
        set up a number of styles to enforce things like maximum heights/widths,
        overflow rules, margins/paddings etc. with the goal of preventing any
        content changes from breaking the layout of the site.
